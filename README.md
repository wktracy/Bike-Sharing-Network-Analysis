## Introduction
In this mini project, we will look at bike-sharing data from Pronto Cycle Share, a short-lived public bike sharing company operated in Seattle, U.S. between October 2014 and August 2016.


The bike sharing dataset was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pronto/cycle-share-dataset


Thanks to the generosity of some bike sharing companies, bike sharing data could often be found online for public download. This enables any interested parties to conduct researches which potentially can help in improving the bike sharing systems. Although most of these datasets does not contain individually identifiable data that enables one to conduct in-depth travel pattern analysis of different riders clusters, we may still be able to gain some understanding about the general travel pattern and habits of riders in a particular region, and possibly make comparison between different bike sharing systems then form a general view of bike sharing behaviour, good and bad practice etc.


So, given the attributes in this dataset, I will demonstrate some possible statistical, temporal and network analysis that most of us as a layman, can attempt. Specifically, we will focus on these questions:
- How does the overall bike network look like? Where do riders usually travel to and from? How does it change over time? Are we able to derive insights about the citizens’ travel habits from this trend?
- Pronto set two types of pricing for two different groups – members and short-term pass holders. How are their ride patterns different? Could there be improvement in pricing?
- We expect weather impacts ridership. How susceptible are different groups of Pronto riders to the adverse weather conditions?
